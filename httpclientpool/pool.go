// A PClient is a pooled HTTP client. A pre-configured *http.Client should
// be passed in to this package's NewPClient() function to get a PClient.
//
// PClients are http.Clients wrapped to extend higher-level functionality.
// A PClient can, and should, be used like a usual http.Client.
//
// Pooling functionality is handled autonomously under the hood.
// PClient can have an upper bound set for the number of connections it
// will make.  They can also be set to rate limit the requests-per-second
// the PClient can perform.
//
// PClients have a Do() method that may help make converting existing
// projects to use this easier. The implementation may not have to change
// to gain the benefits, only the initial type.
//
// The PClient's Transport typically has internal state (cached TCP
// connections), so PClients should be reused instead of created as
// needed. PClients are safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.
//
// For all the interesting details, see client.go.
